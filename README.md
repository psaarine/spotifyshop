This project is a playground for me to try out new aspects of react. 
Even thought it does contain some beautiful visuals, the main reason is to try out some of the more difficult aspects of react. I mainly wanted to get accustomed to using react router since my previous projects havent used it. I also set up a prototype of a shop that I can later adapt. This api uses sessionStorage to simulate database in case user decides to refresh the page.

    Context api
    React router
    React animations
    Dynamic routing
    Shop prototype
    Router on gh pages

I had some problem uploading this to gh-pages at first, since guides I watched suggested me to use something called a HashRouter. Turned out that this does not work, since it disables history that my application really depends on.
